Online Grocery Store is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a real-time grocery shopping experience. Users can register, log in securely, browse products by category, add items to their cart, and place orders. Admins can manage inventory, update product details, and view customer orders. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses Python with Flask and Oracle 10g for database management. Inspired by platforms like Blinkit, this project demonstrates practical implementation of database connectivity, session handling, and e-commerce logic in a user-friendly interface.
